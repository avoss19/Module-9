## Module-9
This repository was for my Engineering class that had us learn Python. 
This repository is mostly excurses from [Learn Python The Hard Way 2](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/preface.html), 
but also includes some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), a calculator w/ a 
UI, and powerpoint that was used to demonstate my knowledge of python.
